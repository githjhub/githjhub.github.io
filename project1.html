  <h1>Comparative analysis of RNA-Seq preprocessing techniques for robust AI-powered disease prediction models</h1>

  <p class="description">
    Although artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing transcriptomic analysis, the influence of preprocessing strategies on model performance and biological interpretation remains largely unexplored. The high dimensionality of RNA-Seq data complicates transcriptomic analysis, yet no benchmark study guides the optimal choice of normalization methods, scaling techniques, or classification algorithms. This gap hinders model optimization and reproducibility, limiting progress in the field. Here, we systematically assess the effects of six normalization methods and three scaling techniques across 13 machine learning (ML) algorithms using whole-transcriptome data from 5,852 RNA-seq samples across 25 cohorts. By optimizing 19.3 million sub-models, we identified how preprocessing impacts model performance, feature selection, and key gene identification, driven primarily by data distribution shifts and their impact on feature importance scores. To functionally validate preprocessing effects on model performance, we developed a transcriptome-based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) classification model, integrating optimized strategies to overcome conventional limitations. To our knowledge, this study is the first systematic examination of preprocessing strategies across multiple cohorts and AI models, demonstrating their impact on feature selection, overfitting, and disease classification, thereby advancing precision medicine and biomarker discovery.
